## Movie Popcorn
* I recreated my Movie Search app, that was done in vanilla JS, to this new app that is completed in React. This is a project that is still in progress. More features will be added on later.

## Emphasis
* Making asynchronous calls with Axios and access data with callbacks
* Utilize Window.localStorage to store user's favorite movies
* Using npm react-bootstrap to use Bootstrap Components
* Fully responsive webpage
* Fetch new data as users click on "load more"
